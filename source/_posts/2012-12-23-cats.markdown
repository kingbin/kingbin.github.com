Well this is a fun new adventure for my blog.

It's moved from blogger.com to a locally hosted site, then to a local wordress install and now gh-pages.

I haven't migrated the old content and I'm not sure I will. I moved to ghpages because my new provider blocks port 80. I was told that port was for nothing but malicious intents.

This new format allows me to use rake commands to generate new posts, test and deploy along with ties to github. I appreciate the approach because it allows me to work in the tools I would spend all day in if I could. I'm using erb templates and other slick plugins that make sense to me as a developer.

I need to figure out how I want to handle some of the little development I did at the house. I went to dyndns and you have to now pay for the service. I believe you can cancel the trial and still be limited to one host. Which will work for what I want to do. I still need to setup the CNAME aliases to point to different services I run at the house.

Probably the best part about all this is that I'm using VI to create posts.

PS: I'm on a mac and had to add a link to the python 2.7 include dir for rake generate this post. I'm not sure if it's documented anywhere, but anywo...
