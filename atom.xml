<p>Well this is a fun new adventure for my blog.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s moved from blogger.com to a locally hosted site, then to a local wordress install and now gh-pages.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t migrated the old content and I&#8217;m not sure I will. I moved to ghpages because my new provider blocks port 80. I was told that port was for nothing but malicious intents.</p>

<p>This new format allows me to use rake commands to generate new posts, test and deploy along with ties to github. I appreciate the approach because it allows me to work in the tools I would spend all day in if I could. I&#8217;m using erb templates and other slick plugins that make sense to me as a developer.</p>

<p>I need to figure out how I want to handle some of the little development I did at the house. I went to dyndns and you have to now pay for the service. I believe you can cancel the trial and still be limited to one host. Which will work for what I want to do. I still need to setup the CNAME aliases to point to different services I run at the house.</p>

<p>Probably the best part about all this is that I&#8217;m using VI to create posts.</p>
